This repository contains my implementations of classes in Numpy with forward and backward methods.

- Activations (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid) -> [activations.py]
- Criterions (MSE, SoftMax, LogSoftmax, CrossEntropyLoss) -> [criterions.py]
- DataLoader -> [dataloader.py]
- Optimizers (on Numpy: SGD and Adam, on Pytorch: Nesterov momentum, RMSProp and Adam) -> [optimizers.py]
- Pools (MaxPool2d and AvgPool2d on PyTorch) -> [pools.py]
- Layers (Linear, Conv2d, Sequential, BatchNorm1d, BatchNorm2d, Dropout) -> [layers.py]
